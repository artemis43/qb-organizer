"""Knowledge Graph Builder — builds the concept mesh from ingested textbook data.

Pipeline per textbook:
  1. For each chapter, fetch its chunks and Claude-extracted topics/key_terms
  2. Send to Claude batch → extract typed concepts + relationships + definitions
  3. Deduplicate against existing graph (fuzzy canonical name match)
  4. Store concepts, relations, and provenance (concept_sources)

Design decisions:
  - Uses Claude Haiku batch (cheap, ~$0.003/chapter) — no SciSpacy dependency
  - All extraction is LLM-based for highest accuracy on medical domain
  - Merges across textbooks: same canonical_name → existing concept + new source
  - Relation types are medical-education specific (is_subtype_of, causes, etc.)

CONCEPT_EXTRACTION_SYSTEM = """You are a senior medical professor and ontologist building a structured medical knowledge graph from MBBS textbook content.

Your task: Extract ALL medical concepts from the given chapter text and identify relationships between them.

CONCEPT TYPES (use exactly):
- disease: pathological conditions (e.g., Anemia, Appendicitis, Fracture)
- anatomy: body structures (e.g., Femur, Brachial Plexus, Mitral Valve)
- procedure: surgical/clinical procedures (e.g., Open Reduction, Appendectomy)
- drug: medications and drug classes (e.g., Warfarin, NSAIDs, Antibiotics)
- symptom: patient complaints and symptoms (e.g., Pain, Fever, Dyspnea)
- investigation: diagnostic tests (e.g., CBC, X-ray, CT Scan, Biopsy)
- pathology: pathological processes/mechanisms (e.g., Inflammation, Necrosis, Fibrosis)
- physiology: normal processes (e.g., Haemostasis, Coagulation Cascade)
- organism: pathogens and organisms (e.g., Staphylococcus, H. pylori)
- syndrome: named syndromes (e.g., Crush Syndrome, Compartment Syndrome)
- sign: clinical signs (e.g., Trendelenburg Sign, Murphy's Sign)
- condition: states/conditions (e.g., Shock, Sepsis, Pregnancy)
- concept: abstract medical concepts (e.g., Virulence, Immunity, Homeostasis)

RELATION TYPES (use exactly):
- is_subtype_of: hierarchical (child → parent)
- causes: agent causes disease/condition
- presents_with: disease presents with symptom/sign
- treated_by: disease/condition → treatment/procedure/drug
- investigated_by: condition → diagnostic test
- complication_of: complication → primary disease/procedure
- associated_with: bidirectional association
- part_of: anatomy → larger structure
- differential_of: differential diagnosis relationship
- risk_factor_for: risk factor → disease
- precedes: temporal/causal sequence
- managed_by: general management
- produces: physiological production (e.g., organ/cell produces hormone/substance)
- metabolized_by: metabolic clearance (e.g., substance metabolized by organ/enzyme)
- innervated_by: nervous supply (e.g., muscle/structure innervated by nerve)
- vascularized_by: blood supply (e.g., organ/structure vascularized by artery/vein)
- contraindicated_in: warning/danger (e.g., drug contraindicated in condition/disease)
- indicated_in: clinical indication (e.g., drug/procedure indicated in condition/disease)
- side_effect_of: adverse effect (e.g., symptom/sign side effect of drug)

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Extract ALL concepts mentioned — from "bone" to "Osteosarcoma"
2. Be specific: "Sickle Cell Anemia" not just "Anemia" for the specific concept
3. Both go in: specific concept AND its parent (with is_subtype_of relation)
4. aliases: common abbreviations and synonyms (e.g., ["SCA", "HbSS disease"])
5. importance: must_know (exam critical), standard (important), advanced (extra)
6. definition: 1 sentence from the textbook content, NOT external knowledge
